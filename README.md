# Cleaning App

This is a React app with typescript that displays a the possible design for an Cleaning Service including a homepage.

# Getting Started

To get started, you can clone this repository and then install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/915-nistor-robert/cleaning-app.git
cd cleaning-app
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

The node version I used for this project is 17.9.1

```
npm start
```

This will start the app in development mode and open it in your default browser at http://localhost:3000. Any changes
you make to the code will automatically reload the page.

# Implementation

I choose to use React with typescript and sass for this project because I am most familiar with them and I think they
are the best tools for this project. I used React because it is a very popular framework and it is very easy to use and
to learn. I used typescript because it is a very good tool for type checking and it is very easy to use. I used sass
because it is a very good tool for styling and think that it can make the styling process a lot more structured.
